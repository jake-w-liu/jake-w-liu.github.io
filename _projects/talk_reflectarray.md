This presentation (Altair 2019 Keynote) introduces a steepest descent method (SDM) for synthesizing convex metallic reflectarray antennas with multi-beam capability. The approach optimizes element phase distributions to achieve multi-sector coverage in millimeter-wave applications. Simulations show enhanced directivity and reduced sidelobe levels through optimized configurations. ([Slides](http://jake-w-liu.github.io/assets/pdf/reflectarray_ATC2019.pdf))
