_PREPARING..._

## Course Description

This is a one-semester graduate course on electromagnetic theory. Chapters 1 and 2 provide a concise review of fundamental concepts, along with selected advanced topics such as the plane wave expansion (PWE). Chapters 3 and 4 focus on more advanced material, including the derivation of radiation fields using vector potentials and the development of the Strattonâ€“Chu formulation. The course concludes with canonical electromagnetic scattering problems. Mathematical tools are introduced as needed throughout the course.

## Course Material

The course slides are divided into four units:

* Chapter 1: Maxwell Equations ([Slides](http://jake-w-liu.github.io/assets/pdf/aem_ch1_maxwell.pdf))
* Chapter 2: Propagation and Transmission ([Slides](http://jake-w-liu.github.io/assets/pdf/aem_ch2_propagation.pdf))
* Chapter 3: Radiation ([Slides](http://jake-w-liu.github.io/assets/pdf/aem_ch3_radiation.pdf))
* Chapter 4: Scattering

## Grading Policy

I fully understand that this is a demanding courseâ€”but don't worry about the grading ðŸ˜†. For details, please refer to the [attached file](http://jake-w-liu.github.io/assets/pdf/grading_presentation.pdf).

## References

No textbook is required for this course, but the following references are highly recommended: (1) Harrington's classic textbook offers a concise yet rigorous treatment of electromagnetic theory. It is strongly recommended, though readers should be mindful of some of its conventions, which may differ from those in other texts. (2) Balanisâ€™ comprehensive text serves as a practical reference manual. While thorough, it can sometimes feel overwhelmingâ€”but it remains a valuable resource. (3) Barkeshliâ€™s concise volume is also a gem. Portions of the lecture content follow his elegant and clear derivations. (4) Pathakâ€™s textbook, written by my academic "grand-advisor" (my advisorâ€™s advisor), presents more advanced material and complements the foundational coverage of the earlier references.
