My research leverages numerical methods to explore elelctromagnetic scattering in random media.</p> <p>My doctoral work focused on developing algorithms for rapid calibration of antenna arrays. My research interests include antenna measurement theory, phased array calibration, computational electromagnetics.</p> <p>In addition, I am a dedicated software developer with a primary focus on Julia programming, creating high-performance solutions for scientific and numerical computing. I am also exploring the JavaScript ecosystem to enhance web-based visualizations and user interaction in research tools.</p> </body></html>
