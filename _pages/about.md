Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm a researcher and software developer. I earned my B.S. in Electrical Engineering and my Ph.D. in Communication Engineering from National Taiwan University in 2017 and 2022, respectively.

My research primarily revolves around:
- computational electromagnetics, with a focus on the pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) method
- antenna array calibration algorithms
- antenna measurement theory and near-to-far-field transformation techniques

In parallel with my research, I'm passionate about developing high-performance scientific software in Julia, with an emphasis on numerical computing, data visualization, and creating interactive tools. If you'd like to connect or chat about my work, feel free to send me an email.
