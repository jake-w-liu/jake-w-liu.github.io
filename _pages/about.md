Starting August 1, 2025, I will be joining the Department of Electronic Engineering at National Taipei University of Technology (NTUT) as an assistant professor.

Currently engaged in a postdoctoral position specializing in optical simulations, with a focus on the pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) method. My research leverages numerical methods to explore elelctromagnetic scattering in random media.

My doctoral work focused on developing algorithms for rapid calibration of antenna arrays. My research interests include antenna measurement theory, phased array calibration, computational electromagnetics.

In addition, I am a dedicated software developer with a primary focus on Julia programming, creating high-performance solutions for scientific and numerical computing. I am also exploring the JavaScript ecosystem to enhance web-based visualizations and user interaction in research tools.
