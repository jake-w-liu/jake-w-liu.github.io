I am an assistant professor in the Department of Electronic Engineering at National Taipei University of Technology (NTUT). My research interests span computational electromagnetics—with a focus on pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) methods—antenna array calibration, and antenna measurement theory. In parallel, I develop high-performance scientific software in Julia, emphasizing numerical computing, data visualization, and user-interactive tools for research applications. Feel free to contact me via email.
