### Course Description

This is a one-semester graduate course on geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD). Covered topics include: (1) fundamentals of classical differential geometry, (2) geometrical optics (GO), (3) scattering from a PEC wedge, (4) asymptotic evaluation of integrals, and (5) GTD and its uniform version (UTD).  

### Course Material

The course material is based on two primary references. The first is the note "_Differential Geometry for GTD Applications_" by S. W. Lee, which has been retypeset in LaTeX. The second is the GTD lecture slide corresponding to Chapter 13 of Balanis’ textbook. Additional supplementary materials are provided as needed. I express appreciation to Professor Pathak for granting permission to reuse selected figures from his book in the preparation of the lecture slides on asymptotic evaluation of integrals.

### References

The primary reference for this course is Balanis' "_Advanced Engineering Electromagnetics_", ch. 13. This chapter offers a concise introduction to the formulation of GO and GTD.

The following references are also recommended:

1. **Pathak and Burkholder** present a rigorous treatment. Professor Pathak is one of the principal developers of UTD.
2. **McNamara, Derek, Albert, and Pistorius** provide an accessible introduction, with clear derivations, particularly in the sections on GO.
