Julia is a high-level, open-source programming language designed for technical computing, providing high performance while maintaining a user-friendly syntax. This presentation introduces Julia's syntax, focusing on its basic data types, control structures, and notable differences from other languages like MATLAB. It also covers the ecosystem of Julia packages, emphasizing package management, code debugging, and linear algebra operations. Advanced topics include parallel computing techniques such as multithreading, asynchronous programming, and distributed computing, making Julia versatile for scientific and technical applications. The presentation concludes with practical advice for transitioning existing projects to Julia and showcases the implementation of a fun project, [FishTank.jl](https://github.com/jake-w-liu/FishTank.jl), demonstrating the language's capabilities in modeling and visualization.
