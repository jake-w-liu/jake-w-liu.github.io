### Course Description

This is a one-semester graduate course on electromagnetic theory. Chapters 1 and 2 provide a concise review of fundamental concepts, along with selected advanced topics such as the plane wave expansion (PWE). Chapters 3 and 4 focus on more advanced material, including the derivation of radiation fields using vector potentials and the development of the Stratton–Chu formulation. The course concludes with canonical electromagnetic scattering problems. Mathematical tools are introduced as needed throughout the course.

### Course Material

The course slides are divided into four units:

* Chapter 1: Maxwell Equations ([Slides](http://jake-w-liu.github.io/assets/pdf/aem_ch1_maxwell.pdf))
* Chapter 2: Propagation and Transmission ([Slides](http://jake-w-liu.github.io/assets/pdf/aem_ch2_propagation.pdf))
* Chapter 3: Radiation ([Slides](http://jake-w-liu.github.io/assets/pdf/aem_ch3_radiation.pdf))
* Chapter 4: Scattering ([Slides](http://jake-w-liu.github.io/assets/pdf/aem_ch4_scattering.pdf))


### References

The primary reference for this course is:

**• J. W. Liu, _Lectures on Electromagnetic Theory_, NTU Press (upcoming...)**

The following references are highly recommended:

1. **Harrington** provides a concise and rigorous treatment of electromagnetic theory. It is strongly recommended, though some notational conventions differ from modern usage.
2. **Balanis** offers a comprehensive and detailed reference. It can feel overwhelming and tedious at times, but remains one of the most reliable all-around sources.
3. **Barkeshli** is a compact and elegant text; parts of these lecture notes closely follow his clear derivations.
4. **Ishimaru**, especially the second edition, gives broad coverage of wave propagation and scattering. However, it contains several typos—consulting the first edition for comparison is often helpful.
5. **Pathak and Burkholder** present more advanced topics; the text serves as an excellent complement to the foundational material above and reflects the lineage of my own academic “grand-advisor.”
