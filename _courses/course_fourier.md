### Course Description

This one-semester graduate course introduces the Fourier transform and its applications, covering periodic functions, Fourier series, the Fourier transform, and the implementation of the fast Fourier transform (FFT).

### Course Material

The primary reference is **Norman Morrison’s _Introduction to Fourier Analysis_**, a pedagogical text well suited for electrical engineering students. 
<!-- It is available through the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/morrison-introduction-to-fourier-analysis).   -->
A [supplementary slide](/assets/pdf/intro_ft.pdf) is provided to give a practical introduction to the Fourier transform. The [lecture notes](/assets/pdf/fourier_note.pdf) are also available.
